				<p>The actor and model has always been conscious of animal rights issues, but when she found herself grounded during quarantine, she wanted to dedicate time to giving back. “Fostering was this thing that I’d always wanted to do,” she shared on the phone from Los Angeles. “When quarantine happened, I started seeing different accounts on Instagram for adoption agencies, and I started reaching out. The first people who got back to me were this foundation called Hollywood Huskies.”</p>

			    <a>Dakota Johnson Just Bought A Surprising New Handbag</a><br>
				<p>Dakota Johnson is a rucksack woman. She likes her bags capacious, yet compact; functional, but discreetly fashionable with minimal branding. The Gucci ambassador is rarely seen without a black leather backpack slung over one shoulder when nipping between Pilates classes, Cha Cha Matcha and Whole Foods – a common circuit among the Los Angeles set. So, when Johnson was recently snapped visiting a friend with *shocker* a new style of handbag, we had to take a second look.</p>

			   <a>Versace</a><br>
			   <p>Gianni Versace S.r.l, usually referred to simply as Versace, is an Italian luxury fashion company and trade name founded by Gianni Versace in 1978. The main collection of the brand is Versace, which produces upmarket Italian-made ready-to-wear and leather accessories. The Versace logo is the head of Medusa, a Greek mythological figure. The logo came from the floor of ruins in the area of Reggio Calabria that the Versace siblings played in as children. Gianni Versace chose Medusa as the logo because she made people fall in love with her and they had no way back. He hoped his company would have the same effect on people and on those who wore his clothes and shoes.<br> The Versace brand is known for its innovative designs having symbolic flashy prints and bright colors but with style. The company announced in 2018 that it would stop using fur in its collections. On 25 September 2018, Michael Kors Holdings acquired all outstanding shares in Gianni Versace S.r.l. for $2.12 billion (USD); the acquisition was completed on 31 December 2018, keeping on Donatella Versace as head of creative design.</p>
